# ChaosGame implementation in C++

This is a simple implementation of the chaos game written in C++. 

## Getting started
To compile and run the code, you need [CMake](https://www.cmake.org) installed on your system. Now you have to create a build directory using 
```mkdir build && cd build```. From here, you execute CMake by calling 
```
cmake <path-to-source-code>
```
where ```<path-to-source-code>``` must be set to the root of the projects directory.
Once CMake has generated the appropriate build files for your system, just run 
```
make release
```
to compile the program into a binary. If you want to build the executable in debug mode, please use ```make debug``` instead.
